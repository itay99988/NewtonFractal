# Newton Fractal Generator

## Introduction
First and foremost, what is fractal? 
In mathematics, a fractal is a detailed, recursive, and infinitely self-similar mathematical set whose Hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds its topological dimension and which is encountered ubiquitously in nature. Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry. If this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge, it is called a self-similar pattern. (Wikipedia)

This fractal generator uses the Newton-Raphson method several times in order to generate the fractal. More backgroud information about this method can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method). This generator uses the fact that the method works for complex number as well.
