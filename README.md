# Newton Fractal Generator

# Introduction
This fractal generator uses the Newton-Raphson method several times in order to generate the fractal. More backgroud information about this method can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method). This generator uses the fact that the method works for complex number as well.
